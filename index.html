                          Nobody's ever been more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. 
                          Ross Perot isn't successful like me. Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. 
                          Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault.

At the same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
